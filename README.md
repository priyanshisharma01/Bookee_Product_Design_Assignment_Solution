### Design a calendar for a Traveling Saleswoman

**Context:** Valentina leads sales and business development for a Fortune 500 company. She travels 3 out of 4 weeks in the month, and when she travels, itâ€™s almost always internationally. Between all her travel to different time zones and a busy meeting schedule in different cities, she finds it challenging to keep up with her calendar to show up to the right places at the right time.

**Challenge:** Design a calendar flow and interface that is smart enough to suggest meeting times, accounts for changing time zones, and is proactively working for Valentina to make sure she is always on time for her meetings. The proposed solution has to be mobile-friendly and has to use viable technologies from today.

**Instructions:** Show your process through user journeys, wireframes, information architecture maps, personas, workflows or any other appropriate method. Submit a minimum of 3-4 unique high fidelity screens. You may optionally submit an interactive prototype as well. Please document your process along with the final screens.

**Evaluation Criteria:** We are looking to see your overall design and problem-solving process, how you break down the problem and translate the concept into workflows and screens. We want to see how you keep the user needs and business goals at the core of your solution and your visual execution skills, use of platform patterns, clarity of thought and attention to detail. Essentially we want to see how you apply your skill-sets to a problem.
